# **Youth Substance Use in Canada: A Data Analytics Approach**

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes adolescent substance use trends and risk factors in Canada using the **2021–2022 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs Survey (CSTADS)**. Leveraging both descriptive and predictive analytics, we aim to uncover insights that can inform evidence-based prevention strategies for educators, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers.

## 🔍 Background & Problem Statement

Adolescent substance use, particularly cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco, poses a growing public health concern in Canada. Despite legislative efforts and prevention programs, youth substance-related hospitalizations remain high—cannabis alone accounts for **40%** of such hospitalizations among youth.

This project investigates:

* Patterns in youth substance use across regions and demographics
* Risk factors including mental health, peer influence, and access
* Policy gaps and opportunities to enhance prevention strategies through data analytics

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives & Questions

### Objectives

* Analyze the key determinants of adolescent smoking, drinking, and cannabis use
* Compare substance use across provinces, genders, and urban vs. rural contexts
* Provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders

### Key Questions

1. What are the major risk factors driving youth substance use in Canada?
2. How do substance use trends differ across regions and demographics?
3. How can analytics enhance substance use prevention and policymaking?

---

## 🧠 Significance

By combining epidemiological insight with data science methods, this study offers:

* Predictive models to identify high-risk populations
* Regional and demographic insights to customize prevention efforts
* Evidence to support community-based and policy-level interventions

---

## 📚 Literature Review Summary

Prior research highlights that substance use in youth is influenced by:

* **Individual factors**: Early exposure, gender, perceived risk, mental health
* **Social factors**: Parental guidance, peer pressure, bullying, SES

Emerging methods such as machine learning, geospatial analysis, and social media monitoring are increasingly used to identify trends and guide interventions—but are underutilized in Canadian policy. This study addresses this gap.

## 📂 Data & Methodology

### Data Source

* **Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS)** 2021-2022
* Public Use Microdata File (CSV), 61,096 student cases, Grades 7–12

### Analysis Techniques

* **Descriptive Statistics** (e.g., prevalence by gender, province, grade)
* **Logistic Regression** (e.g., predictors of smoking or cannabis use)
* **Decision Trees** for classification
* **Chi-square Tests**, **T-tests**, **ANOVA** for group comparisons

### Example Variables

* Independent: Age, gender, location, mental health, peer influence
* Dependent: Usage (yes/no), frequency of tobacco/alcohol/cannabis

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* `pandas` for data handling
* `numpy` for numerical analysis
* `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for visualizations
* `scikit-learn` for predictive models (logistic regression, decision trees)

---

## 📈 Results Summary *(to be updated with analysis)*

* Key risk factors identified for cannabis and alcohol use
* Gender and rural/urban location significantly affect prevalence
* Predictive models show strong accuracy in identifying high-risk groups

*→ See Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks` for details.*
